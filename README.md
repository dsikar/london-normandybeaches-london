# London - Normandy Beaches - London

GPS files optimised for the Garmin Etrex 10 

## Preamble

The Garmin Etrex 10 has a 500 waypoint limit per track so the procedure below describes how to adapt tracks to work around this limit. 

## Route

The route was conceived in 4 stages:  

1. London - Newhaven
2. Dieppe - Caen
3. Caen - Cherbourg
4. Portsmouth - London

## Generating "raw" data

Stages were generated on Strava.com as routes. Each stage then subdivided in approximately 50km sectors, which can be reduced to 500 waypoints without much loss of overlap with original maximum resolution route, then exported as .gpx files.

## Reducing number of waypoints per track

This was achieved by uploading .gpx files to http://labs.easyblog.it/maps/gpx-simplify-optimizer/, reducing number of nodes to 500 or less then downloading the simplified file.

## Original .gpx file list

Note the original 4 stages include an attempt to simplify tracks to 500 nodes, which proved too much of a loss in resolution (simplified files deviating excessively from high resolution to the point of potentially disrupting navigation).
